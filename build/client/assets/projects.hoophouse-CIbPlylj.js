A hoop house is a structure created with the intent to maintain warmth in a space throughout cold winter months. It emulates a small-scale greenhouse and is often made of a tightly stretched plastic paired with a rigid structural material, but should still be light enough to move. Designed by a team of five: Joanne Chui, Yingying Yan, Ammar Hassonjee, Taisei Manheim, and Samuel Losi, this hoop house plays on the dueling aesthetics of amoeba-esque rope joints and an ordered Y-shaped structure."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("img",{alt:"",id:"8",src:"/mats/hoop_house/photo_joint.jpg"}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"A few notable things came from researching precedents of hoop houses. Firstly, the method of inner access was always the dealbreaker for functioning as a warmth-containing enclosure. The final design’s zipper opening is rationalized by its ease of access, and air-tightness. And secondly, each hoop house we found used the aluminum-conduit skeleton as “drive-curves,” where the plastic, once pulled taught around the structure, was defined by sweeping curves."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("img",{alt:"",id:"2",src:"/mats/hoop_house/joints01.jpg"}),e.jsx("img",{alt:"",id:"3",src:"/mats/hoop_house/joints02.jpg"}),e.jsx("img",{alt:"",id:"4",src:"/mats/hoop_house/joints03.jpg"}),e.jsx("img",{alt:"",id:"5",src:"/mats/hoop_house/joints04.jpg"}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"This take on the hoop-house design uses a series of “drive-points” to determine the shape of the plastic.

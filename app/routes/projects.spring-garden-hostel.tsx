			<p>
				The brick shell of a long-deserted shoe factory and a parcel of land
				adjacent to a heavy intersection served as the site for urban hostel.
				The two-story brick facades became the cornerstone of design throughout
				the adaptive reuse project and supported the play of interstitial space,
				manipulating the experiences of inside and out.

			<br />
			<p>
				To maintain the experience of solidarity within the existing shell, the
				hostel's private resident rooms are placed on higher floors of the
				adjacent parcel. The interior of the brick shell serves predominately as
				a courtyard and is flanked by a multitude of transparent semiprivate
				spaces.

			<p>
				The hostel's public space is located on the first floor of the
				additional parcel of land, drawing in foot traffic and granting glimpses
				of the interior of the brick facades.

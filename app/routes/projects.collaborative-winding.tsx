		<h1>Inverted Weaving: Robotic Collaboration (2020)</h1>
		<br />
		<p>
			Collabrative Weaving is a robotic research/ fabrication project that
			proposes a system that utilizes robotic weaving based on an object. This
			project was a collaboration with Nick Coppula.

			This process required collaboration between two robots and was written
			in RAPID and HAL for grasshopper. The ABB 4400 robot moves the material
			to a position inside the frame and the ABB 6640 robot loops the material
			onto a fastening system on the exterior of the frame. This robotic
			collaboration enables the internal complexity of weaving while
			maintaining a regular external frame geometry, which is then expressed
			by repeatedly bringing numerous strands back to a set of fixed
			positions.

		<p>
			The project's form has a complex, spatial interior rather than a
			regulated exterior. This makes it distinct from many precedent projects
			which heavily rely on robotically woven structures aptly described as
			“shells”. The collaborators proposed a system of weaving that is
			adaptable and builds upon the existing formal language surrounding
			robotically woven structures. Inverted weaving was the development of an
			inside-out approach to weaving where the basic frame becomes external
			and the complexity becomes internal.

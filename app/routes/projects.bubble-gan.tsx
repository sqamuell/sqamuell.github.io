				The Bubble2Floor is an implementation of the Pix2Pix GAN-model, and is a
				tool for spatial prototyping of built spaces. This project was completed
				in collaboration with Twisha Raja. It works in three main steps-

			<p>
				The objective of the bubble2floor Generator the design of housing units.
				The workflow is includes the use of a few different softwares that are
				popularly employed in design circles.

				Bubble-diagrams generated from the Rhino-Grasshopper workspace are
				pushed through a pytorch model trained on bubble-diagram and floor plan
				pairs.This model is utilized to generate a series of floor plan
				representations of the bubble-diagram, which then creates approximated
				room geometries using openCV on these images.
			</p>

			<br />
			<p>
				The generated floor plan image is then passed through openCV to define
				the locations of walls. Finally, the walls are extruded with Rhino &
				Grasshopper, then tweaked to the designersâ€™ liking.

				A wide variety of Photogrammetry technology exists today. They take a series
				of images and reconstruct a 3D form based on the content of the images. This
				project situates itself amongst these, allowing the user to
				generate a 3D model from 360-degree images through online databases.
				Much other software including Autodesk Recap, Multi-view environment,
				and Meshroom all serve to generate geometry from image distances. In
				fact, humanâ€™s perception of space uses the same underlying logic as all
				these programs. The slight differences in images sent to our brain from
				our eyes tells us what is near and what is far.

				The project, titled placeHolder, was an exploration of photogrammetric
				techniques written from-scratch with Python. It is an inquiry into quick
				generation of site geometry (buildings, roads, etc.) for use in site
				mapping and architectural design. First, the user selects two 360-degree
				panoramic images either from google maps or elsewhere. Then, placeMaker
				interprets the selected images and detects edges. Finally, the program
				cross-references the images to place them in 3D space and allows the
				user to fly through and examine the projected geometry.

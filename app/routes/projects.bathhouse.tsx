		<h1>Saco Lake Bathhouse (2019)</h1>
		<br />
		<p>
			This bathhouse is an exploration of experiential sequences a visitor
			takes throughout a structure's parti. Its structure is a reflection on
			the verticality of the New Hampshire forest where it resides. The
			entryway, changing rooms, and three baths (quite unrealistically) nestle
			inside the forest of pillars, floating above the forest floor and
			causing the internal relationships of the structure to become truly
			three-dimensional.

		<br />
		<p>
			The structure's partitioning of interior and exterior spaces and bath's
			encourages the pairing of hot and cold during the extreme seasons. A
			visit in the summer grants the patron an ice-cold refresh from the heat
			and humidity of the outside. In the winter, the bathhouse's hot pool
			gives a respite from the chill and the snow. During temperate months,
			the bathhouse offers a more mellowed experience. Though the seasons
			affect the sequential experience of the baths the structure frames the
			surrounding forest year-round.

		<p>
			The final structure of the bathhouse was born from a series of
			exploratory models that, early on, took an affinity towards vertical
			columns and the grid. The interplay of light and shadow within these
			models revealed the opportunity to attune to the seasons and greatly
			influenced the placement and orientation of programmatic elements.
			Adding the third dimension to the grid and relating the final design to
			the slope allowed for an array of framed views out into the forest and
			valley beyond.

			<h1>Saco Lake Bathhouse (2019)</h1>
			<br />
			<p>
				This bathhouse is an exploration of experiential sequences a visitor
				takes throughout a structure's parti. Its structure is a reflection on
				the verticality of the New Hampshire forest where it resides. The
				entryway, changing rooms, and three baths (quite unrealistically) nestle
				inside the forest of pillars, floating above the forest floor and
				causing the internal relationships of the structure to become truly
				three-dimensional.

			<br />
			<p>
				The structure's partitioning of interior and exterior spaces and bath's
				encourages the pairing of hot and cold during the extreme seasons. A
				visit in the summer grants the patron an ice-cold refresh from the heat
				and humidity of the outside. In the winter, the bathhouse's hot pool
				gives a respite from the chill and the snow. During temperate months,
				the bathhouse offers a more mellowed experience. Though the seasons
				affect the sequential experience of the baths the structure frames the
				surrounding forest year-round.

			<p>
				The final structure of the bathhouse was born from a series of
				exploratory models that, early on, took an affinity towards vertical
				columns and the grid. The interplay of light and shadow within these
				models revealed the opportunity to attune to the seasons and greatly
				influenced the placement and orientation of programmatic elements.
				Adding the third dimension to the grid and relating the final design to
				the slope allowed for an array of framed views out into the forest and
				valley beyond.

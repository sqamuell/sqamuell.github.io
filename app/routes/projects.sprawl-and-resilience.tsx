				This project looks to generate a critique of the suburb within the minds
				of its residents, challenging the attitude of growth that enables
				suburban sprawl and giving a voice to non-human residents of
				pre-developed land. The suburban landscape is vast and growing; a single
				spatial intervention would not impact a significant amount of
				suburbanites. Thus, the project materializes itself as a living room
				board game where players work together and compete to restrain suburban
				development over the board. Transforming their mindset in the span of a
				few hours is impossible, so this project positions itself as a platform
				to catalyze the imagination of collective thoughts.

				The board game takes place in a soon-to-be developed land on the
				outskirts of American Suburbia. The game's gameplay is asymmetrical,
				meaning that each team has differing gameplay styles that begin to
				determine their power, action, and strategy.

			<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
			<p>
				This thesis was born out of my own life experience. My childhood took
				place in the suburbs south of Cleveland, Ohio, USA and it was there that
				I gained first-hand experiences of this urban form. But I, much like the
				majority of people living there, was clueless to the troubles I was
				inadvertently a part of. It should be noted that no single person is
				responsible for any of the problems of suburbia. Placing blame on
				individuals (aside from those who have great power and money) is
				unhelpful and irrelevant. These problems are something of a wicked
				nature, where change must be made collectively.

				While the image of suburbia as we know it began in the late 1940s, its
				roots can be traced much earlier, namely to the Palace of Versailles.
				French King Louis XIV's magnificent show of wealth determined, more than
				anything else, the quality of the suburban landscape. Versailles' vast
				and well-kept lawns, and those at the end of a cul-de-sac may be very
				different in scale, but both ultimately are a physical manifestation of
				wealth. The lawn is a visage into American culture and belief. Diller +
				Scofidio's The American Lawn: Surface of Everyday Life(1998) “reveals
				the lawn as a domestic symbol, civic showplace, economic force, and
				national icon.” The showcasing of lawn-keeping machinery, various types
				of turf, and reverent depictions of lawn archetypes, a revelation of
				both respect and irony are created. The curated showmanship of an
				individual's lawn lets you understand a lot about them and, on a larger
				scale, becomes representative of many dimensions of American life.

				The lawn is the driving force of spatial use in the suburban landscape.
				A lawn more curated than its neighbors shows who's the wealthiest on the
				street. It's a social game that requires a massive amount of space where
				playing is the only option. Suburbanites' desires for their own personal
				Garden of Versailles maintains the market for this extremely sparse
				living, and demand continues to grow. Suburban homes, such as those I
				grew up in, are isolated from one another. With an average of 2,300
				square feet (213 square meters) in 2020, American homes are big for the
				average of 2.6 people that reside in them. Villas, such as these, are
				found across the entire suburban landscape. I speculate that this
				separation of individuals and families leads to psychological issues
				that have arisen in the past decades. Micro-cultures form within family
				units and emotional-social-support systems are often not present in
				children and adolescents' lives. While this has not yet been examined
				academically, the lack of cooperative and social lives is astounding.

			<p>
				Soon-to-be felled forests make way for enormous infrastructure projects,
				housing developments, and retail districts shaping the foundations of
				mine and other suburbanites' behaviors. Reliance on automobiles and lack
				of proper walkable places, even towards the urban center of Cleveland is
				assumed and not interrogated for many, well-documented reasons. Firstly,
				automobiles, their quality, and the individual's upkeep of them are a
				sign of wealth. Automobiles, like lawns and many other things, are a
				part of the cultural theatrics that Americans take part in. Secondly,
				there is a lack of extensive, reliable public transportation. This is
				partly due to the previously mentioned question of wealth: public
				transportation in many parts of the country is seen as welfare. See
				below for the Strongsville, Ohio mall and the size of the parking lot
				that services it.

				To me, suburbanites' connections to the natural world is the only real
				amenity that one may not find as accessible anywhere else. Where
				present, parks and nature reserves serve as a quiet respite from busy
				life. But even this comes at the cost of the natural world's
				commodification; in the eyes of Mother Nature, it is a selfish act to
				divide forests with innumerable roads and trails for human enjoyment.
				Forests and lakes, previously undisturbed places, become spots of
				recreation for those who can afford to make the trip to them and
				infrastructure facilitating transportation and recreation are quickly
				created to take advantage of their capital gain. The human landscape is
				now dominating the natural landscape so much that nature, as we
				conceptualize it, is now manmade.

				As someone who grew up in the suburbs and has experienced less
				resource-intensive ways of living since, I have begun to understand both
				the advantages and disadvantages, costs and privileges that come with
				living in an American suburb. From experience and further research, this
				thesis became an attempt to reveal underlying socio-political tensions
				of the suburban landscape and to remind suburbanites that our friends in
				the natural world exist, even as we seek to conform their habitats to
				our own.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h2>SYNTHESIS</h2>
			<br />
			<p>
				The problems discussed above are not easy to solve. Habits are grounded
				in cultural belief and foundational understanding and quick changes to
				such things across so many people is impossible. Change must come slowly
				and as a collective. The vastness of the suburban landscape poses an
				interesting problem for an architecture student: how could a single
				structure conveying these ideals reach a target audience spread across
				thousands of miles? Architecture is typically built in one place and
				serves the community surrounding it. A static structure is clearly not
				the correct choice. The medium must be something that could travel place
				to place. A mobile medium that reaches those who might not encounter
				these ideas otherwise. A direct description might appear as a method of
				challenging beliefs rather than simply sharing alternative beliefs.
				Thus, the thesis becomes a board game. Mechanics and rules of board
				games act as a platform for players to role-play, embody and learn
				together.
			</p>
			<br />

			<br />
			<p>
				This thesis chose to focus on the issues regarding the devaluation of
				the natural world. Suburban development continues to expand outwards,
				covering forests, fields, and other habitats with single-family homes
				and asphalt. In light of the ever-increasing issues of climate change
				and biodiversity loss, suburban development and its lifestyle are
				becoming increasingly negative. The protagonists of the game are the
				Woodland Creatures of the natural world. In light of their habitat
				destruction, they must face evil and work together in order to come out
				alive.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				In any good narrative, a well-rounded villain and antagonist is
				absolutely necessary to drive a conflict. The thesis's villain is the
				Developer: a wealthy individual in the suburbs that represents and
				embodies the issues of suburbia. The Developer and the Woodland
				Creatures struggle for territory on the board, and power dynamics and
				imbalances between the two parties arise.
			</p>
			<br />

			<br />
			<p>
				The mechanics of the game give far more power to the Developer than to
				the Woodland Creatures. It is intended that as players sit around a
				table together, a social dynamic arises where the few (the Developer)
				have the majority of the power in changing the board state and the many
				(the Woodland Creatures) must rapidly adapt their actions to combat
				impending decisions and strategies.

				Fortunately, the step of creating a dynamic board grounded in reality
				had unexpected historical precedent the thesis could draw from. In 1785
				and to circumvent issues of change in the natural world, Thomas
				Jefferson proposed that sale and surveying of land in the United States,
				despite most natural boundaries, be fit to a grid. Jefferson's method is
				still in use and these square mile plots of land are clearly visible
				from an aerial view. The grid's disregard for the boundaries, habitats,
				and wildlife of the land set a standard for American living that is
				still evident in midsets today. The Jefferson Grid, well-documented by
				artist and photographer Shabtai Panchevshy, serves as a tile system from
				which the board game thesis took advantage of. The board became a 14in
				by 14in square, poised for a possible 16 square mile tiles of
				development.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h2>OUTCOME</h2>
			<br />
			<p>
				This thesis manifests itself as an asymmetrical board game where the
				Woodland Creatures and the Developer have a power struggle over a
				portion of land. The Woodland Creatures, consisting of up to 5 players,
				fill the roles of native flora and fauna and are powerless on their own.
				Only through collaboration, communication, and synergizing of
				character-specific abilities, can begin to have real impact on the
				board. The Developer, a one player team, makes broad strokes through the
				process of development. Her gameplay, known as engine building, consists
				of a positive feedback loop between capital investments and income.
			</p>
			<br />
			<img

			/>
			<br />
			<p>
				On the board, the Woodland Creatures are represented as figurines, open
				and readily affected by changes in the board state. The Woodland
				Creatures work together in order to halt the impending development and
				make the forests resilient. Their gameplay style is all about adapting
				to change as a team, making decisions together that best fits their
				collective win-condition. The Developer, on the other hand, is not
				represented on the board. The player embodies the Developer character,
				physically representing the idea of the top-down vision of a suburban
				developer. The Developer works solo, making decisions based on his or
				her current and projected income, trying to maximize profit while
				working around the cooperative efforts of the Woodland Creatures. She
				spends time each turn awarding his or herself capital income, making
				moves to develop, laughing maniacally, and bathing in her power.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				The actions and relationships between players constructs tensions
				between the Developer and the Woodland Residents. The constructed
				dynamic that arises from one player with lots of power vs many with not
				small amounts becomes contradictory to the physical presence the players
				have when seated when around the table. This designed experience
				highlights the inequalities that arise from classes, power struggles,
				and erasure. The Woodland Creatures are influenced to use practices of
				commoning to combat the imbalances they face from the other side of the
				board.

				The thesis and board game were fortunate enough to be exhibited in the
				2022 Carnegie Mellon University School of Architecture Symposium, where
				many took part in learning the rules and playing. The social dynamic
				between teams did arise. It was exciting to discuss and learn from this
				experience as problems regarding replayability of the board game were
				brought to light. I learned that if the game was to become a widespread,
				accessible critique of the suburbs, some changes would need to be made.

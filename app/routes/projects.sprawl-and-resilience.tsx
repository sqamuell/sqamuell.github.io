			This project looks to generate a critique of the suburb within the minds
			of its residents, challenging the attitude of growth that enables
			suburban sprawl and giving a voice to non-human residents of
			pre-developed land. The suburban landscape is vast and growing; a single
			spatial intervention would not impact a significant amount of
			suburbanites. Thus, the project materializes itself as a living room
			board game where players work together and compete to restrain suburban
			development over the board. Transforming their mindset in the span of a
			few hours is impossible, so this project positions itself as a platform
			to catalyze the imagination of collective thoughts.

			The board game takes place in a soon-to-be developed land on the
			outskirts of American Suburbia. The game's gameplay is asymmetrical,
			meaning that each team has differing gameplay styles that begin to
			determine their power, action, and strategy.

		<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
		<p>
			This thesis was born out of my own life experience. My childhood took
			place in the suburbs south of Cleveland, Ohio, USA and it was there that
			I gained first-hand experiences of this urban form. But I, much like the
			majority of people living there, was clueless to the troubles I was
			inadvertently a part of. It should be noted that no single person is
			responsible for any of the problems of suburbia. Placing blame on
			individuals (aside from those who have great power and money) is
			unhelpful and irrelevant. These problems are something of a wicked
			nature, where change must be made collectively.

			While the image of suburbia as we know it began in the late 1940s, its
			roots can be traced much earlier, namely to the Palace of Versailles.
			French King Louis XIV's magnificent show of wealth determined, more than
			anything else, the quality of the suburban landscape. Versailles' vast
			and well-kept lawns, and those at the end of a cul-de-sac may be very
			different in scale, but both ultimately are a physical manifestation of
			wealth. The lawn is a visage into American culture and belief. Diller +
			Scofidio's The American Lawn: Surface of Everyday Life(1998) “reveals
			the lawn as a domestic symbol, civic showplace, economic force, and
			national icon.” The showcasing of lawn-keeping machinery, various types
			of turf, and reverent depictions of lawn archetypes, a revelation of
			both respect and irony are created. The curated showmanship of an
			individual's lawn lets you understand a lot about them and, on a larger
			scale, becomes representative of many dimensions of American life.

			The lawn is the driving force of spatial use in the suburban landscape.
			A lawn more curated than its neighbors shows who's the wealthiest on the
			street. It's a social game that requires a massive amount of space where
			playing is the only option. Suburbanites' desires for their own personal
			Garden of Versailles maintains the market for this extremely sparse
			living, and demand continues to grow. Suburban homes, such as those I
			grew up in, are isolated from one another. With an average of 2,300
			square feet (213 square meters) in 2020, American homes are big for the
			average of 2.6 people that reside in them. Villas, such as these, are
			found across the entire suburban landscape. I speculate that this
			separation of individuals and families leads to psychological issues
			that have arisen in the past decades. Micro-cultures form within family
			units and emotional-social-support systems are often not present in
			children and adolescents' lives. While this has not yet been examined
			academically, the lack of cooperative and social lives is astounding.

		<p>
			Soon-to-be felled forests make way for enormous infrastructure projects,
			housing developments, and retail districts shaping the foundations of
			mine and other suburbanites' behaviors. Reliance on automobiles and lack
			of proper walkable places, even towards the urban center of Cleveland is
			assumed and not interrogated for many, well-documented reasons. Firstly,
			automobiles, their quality, and the individual's upkeep of them are a
			sign of wealth. Automobiles, like lawns and many other things, are a
			part of the cultural theatrics that Americans take part in. Secondly,
			there is a lack of extensive, reliable public transportation. This is
			partly due to the previously mentioned question of wealth: public
			transportation in many parts of the country is seen as welfare. See
			below for the Strongsville, Ohio mall and the size of the parking lot
			that services it.

		<p>
			To me, suburbanites' connections to the natural world is the only real
			amenity that one may not find as accessible anywhere else. Where
			present, parks and nature reserves serve as a quiet respite from busy
			life. But even this comes at the cost of the natural world's
			commodification; in the eyes of Mother Nature, it is a selfish act to
			divide forests with innumerable roads and trails for human enjoyment.
			Forests and lakes, previously undisturbed places, become spots of
			recreation for those who can afford to make the trip to them and
			infrastructure facilitating transportation and recreation are quickly
			created to take advantage of their capital gain. The human landscape is
			now dominating the natural landscape so much that nature, as we
			conceptualize it, is now manmade.

			As someone who grew up in the suburbs and has experienced less
			resource-intensive ways of living since, I have begun to understand both
			the advantages and disadvantages, costs and privileges that come with
			living in an American suburb. From experience and further research, this
			thesis became an attempt to reveal underlying socio-political tensions
			of the suburban landscape and to remind suburbanites that our friends in
			the natural world exist, even as we seek to conform their habitats to
			our own.
		</p>
		<br />
		<h2>SYNTHESIS</h2>
		<br />
		<p>
			The problems discussed above are not easy to solve. Habits are grounded
			in cultural belief and foundational understanding and quick changes to
			such things across so many people is impossible. Change must come slowly
			and as a collective. The vastness of the suburban landscape poses an
			interesting problem for an architecture student: how could a single
			structure conveying these ideals reach a target audience spread across
			thousands of miles? Architecture is typically built in one place and
			serves the community surrounding it. A static structure is clearly not
			the correct choice. The medium must be something that could travel place
			to place. A mobile medium that reaches those who might not encounter
			these ideas otherwise. A direct description might appear as a method of
			challenging beliefs rather than simply sharing alternative beliefs.
			Thus, the thesis becomes a board game. Mechanics and rules of board
			games act as a platform for players to role-play, embody and learn
			together.
		</p>
		<br />
		<img alt="" id="8" src={"/mats/sprawl_resilience/equality.jpg"} />
		<br />
		<p>
			This thesis chose to focus on the issues regarding the devaluation of
			the natural world. Suburban development continues to expand outwards,
			covering forests, fields, and other habitats with single-family homes
			and asphalt. In light of the ever-increasing issues of climate change
			and biodiversity loss, suburban development and its lifestyle are
			becoming increasingly negative. The protagonists of the game are the
			Woodland Creatures of the natural world. In light of their habitat
			destruction, they must face evil and work together in order to come out
			alive.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			In any good narrative, a well-rounded villain and antagonist is
			absolutely necessary to drive a conflict. The thesis's villain is the
			Developer: a wealthy individual in the suburbs that represents and
			embodies the issues of suburbia. The Developer and the Woodland
			Creatures struggle for territory on the board, and power dynamics and
			imbalances between the two parties arise.
		</p>
		<br />

		<br />
		<p>
			The mechanics of the game give far more power to the Developer than to
			the Woodland Creatures. It is intended that as players sit around a
			table together, a social dynamic arises where the few (the Developer)
			have the majority of the power in changing the board state and the many
			(the Woodland Creatures) must rapidly adapt their actions to combat
			impending decisions and strategies.

			Fortunately, the step of creating a dynamic board grounded in reality
			had unexpected historical precedent the thesis could draw from. In 1785
			and to circumvent issues of change in the natural world, Thomas
			Jefferson proposed that sale and surveying of land in the United States,
			despite most natural boundaries, be fit to a grid. Jefferson's method is
			still in use and these square mile plots of land are clearly visible
			from an aerial view. The grid's disregard for the boundaries, habitats,
			and wildlife of the land set a standard for American living that is
			still evident in midsets today. The Jefferson Grid, well-documented by
			artist and photographer Shabtai Panchevshy, serves as a tile system from
			which the board game thesis took advantage of. The board became a 14in
			by 14in square, poised for a possible 16 square mile tiles of
			development.
		</p>
		<br />
		<h2>OUTCOME</h2>
		<br />
		<p>
			This thesis manifests itself as an asymmetrical board game where the
			Woodland Creatures and the Developer have a power struggle over a
			portion of land. The Woodland Creatures, consisting of up to 5 players,
			fill the roles of native flora and fauna and are powerless on their own.
			Only through collaboration, communication, and synergizing of
			character-specific abilities, can begin to have real impact on the
			board. The Developer, a one player team, makes broad strokes through the
			process of development. Her gameplay, known as engine building, consists
			of a positive feedback loop between capital investments and income.
		</p>
		<br />
		<img

		/>
		<br />
		<p>
			On the board, the Woodland Creatures are represented as figurines, open
			and readily affected by changes in the board state. The Woodland
			Creatures work together in order to halt the impending development and
			make the forests resilient. Their gameplay style is all about adapting
			to change as a team, making decisions together that best fits their
			collective win-condition. The Developer, on the other hand, is not
			represented on the board. The player embodies the Developer character,
			physically representing the idea of the top-down vision of a suburban
			developer. The Developer works solo, making decisions based on his or
			her current and projected income, trying to maximize profit while
			working around the cooperative efforts of the Woodland Creatures. She
			spends time each turn awarding his or herself capital income, making
			moves to develop, laughing maniacally, and bathing in her power.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p>
			The actions and relationships between players constructs tensions
			between the Developer and the Woodland Residents. The constructed
			dynamic that arises from one player with lots of power vs many with not
			small amounts becomes contradictory to the physical presence the players
			have when seated when around the table. This designed experience
			highlights the inequalities that arise from classes, power struggles,
			and erasure. The Woodland Creatures are influenced to use practices of
			commoning to combat the imbalances they face from the other side of the
			board.

			The thesis and board game were fortunate enough to be exhibited in the
			2022 Carnegie Mellon University School of Architecture Symposium, where
			many took part in learning the rules and playing. The social dynamic
			between teams did arise. It was exciting to discuss and learn from this
			experience as problems regarding replayability of the board game were
			brought to light. I learned that if the game was to become a widespread,
			accessible critique of the suburbs, some changes would need to be made.

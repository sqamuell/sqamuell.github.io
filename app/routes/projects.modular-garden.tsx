			<h1>Modular Garden: An Expanding Pattern (2019)</h1>

			<p>
				The proposal of a hanging garden installation prompted this
				computationally-driven exploration. Iteration on a simple formal logic
				through digitally fabricated models led to an assembly of asymmetrical
				modules. This project was completed in CMU soa's Introduction to
				Computational Design seminar in collaboration with Jasmine Lee, Vivian
				Teng, and Adam He.

				Contrasting squares and circles begin to speak to one another through
				careful play of negative space and light. Introduction of a smaller
				module to deviate from the regularity of the standard grid allowed for
				the differentiated aggregation of modules and variation in all
				directions.

				The module design led to the discovery of a secondary circular element,
				as shown in the cut sheet below. The interior portion of the main module
				was adapted into another element to the tessellating design. There was a
				missed opportunity for the main modules to be rotated to produce an
				additional circular element, a mistake the team learned from. This
				process-driven conceptualization allowed the project to save on material
				waste, a common obstacle in CNC manufacturing.

		<h1>Cybernetic Field: Responsive Algorithm (2021)</h1>
		<br />
		<p>
			This project considers W. Ross Ashby's model for cybernetic architecture
			and seeks to create a homeostatic machine through Processing and the use
			of projection mapping. Cybernetic Field was completed incollaboration
			with Joshua Cao. Cybernetic field begins with a scene of
			randomly-generated points that are influenced by an underlying vector
			field. They gradually find a dynamic stable loop or orbit within the
			field, collectively reaching homeostatsis. Then, flattening the depth
			image of a three-dimensional space to the projector plane with a Kinect,
			the algorithm captures objects and actors in the scene. From these
			environment elements, contour information is extracted and used to
			recalculate vector directions and amplitudes within the field. The
			points are then affected by the change in vectors, reaching many states
			of disorder in the process of restabilizing themselves. Balance will
			always restore itself and the system will return to stability, always in
			a new fashion. Throughout the entire process, human actors are motivated
			to interact with the system, affect the pattern in the vector field, and
			have agency to be creative with a series of experimental different
			movements.

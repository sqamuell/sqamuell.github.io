        This project looks to generate a critique of the suburb within the minds
        of its residents, challenging the attitude of growth that enables suburban
        sprawl and giving a voice to non-human residents of pre-developed land.
        The suburban landscape is vast and growing; a single spatial intervention
        would not impact a significant amount of suburbanites. Thus, the project
        materializes itself as a living room board game where players work together
        and compete to restrain suburban development over the board. Transforming
        their mindset in the span of a few hours is impossible, so this project
        positions itself as a platform to catalyze the imagination of collective
        thoughts.
        <br><br>
        The board game takes place in a soon-to-be developed land on the outskirts
        of American Suburbia. The game’s gameplay is asymmetrical, meaning that
        each team has differing gameplay styles that begin to determine their
        power, action, and strategy.

      <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
      <p>
        This thesis was born out of my own life experience. My childhood took place in the suburbs south of Cleveland,
        Ohio, USA and it was there that I gained first-hand experiences of this urban form. But I, much like the
        majority of people living there, was clueless to the troubles I was inadvertently a part of. It should be noted
        that no single person is responsible for any of the problems of suburbia. Placing blame on individuals (aside
        from those who have great power and money) is unhelpful and irrelevant. These problems are something of a wicked
        nature, where change must be made collectively.

        While the image of suburbia as we know it began in the late 1940s, its roots can be traced much earlier, namely
        to the Palace of Versailles. French King Louis XIV’s magnificent show of wealth determined, more than anything
        else, the quality of the suburban landscape. Versailles’ vast and well-kept lawns, and those at the end of a
        cul-de-sac may be very different in scale, but both ultimately are a physical manifestation of wealth. The lawn
        is a visage into American culture and belief. Diller + Scofidio’s The American Lawn: Surface of Everyday
        Life(1998) “reveals the lawn as a domestic symbol, civic showplace, economic force, and national icon.” The
        showcasing of lawn-keeping machinery, various types of turf, and reverent depictions of lawn archetypes, a
        revelation of both respect and irony are created. The curated showmanship of an individual’s lawn lets you
        understand a lot about them and, on a larger scale, becomes representative of many dimensions of American life.

        The lawn is the driving force of spatial use in the suburban landscape. A lawn more curated than its neighbors
        shows who’s the wealthiest on the street. It’s a social game that requires a massive amount of space where
        playing is the only option. Suburbanites’ desires for their own personal Garden of Versailles maintains the
        market for this extremely sparse living, and demand continues to grow. Suburban homes, such as those I grew up
        in, are isolated from one another. With an average of 2,300 square feet (213 square meters) in 2020, American
        homes are big for the average of 2.6 people that reside in them. Villas, such as these, are found across the
        entire suburban landscape. I speculate that this separation of individuals and families leads to psychological
        issues that have arisen in the past decades. Micro-cultures form within family units and
        emotional-social-support systems are often not present in children and adolescents’ lives. While this has not
        yet been examined academically, the lack of cooperative and social lives is astounding.

        Soon-to-be felled forests make way for enormous infrastructure projects, housing developments, and retail
        districts shaping the foundations of mine and other suburbanites’ behaviors. Reliance on automobiles and lack of
        proper walkable places, even towards the urban center of Cleveland is assumed and not interrogated for many,
        well-documented reasons. Firstly, automobiles, their quality, and the individual’s upkeep of them are a sign of
        wealth. Automobiles, like lawns and many other things, are a part of the cultural theatrics that Americans take
        part in. Secondly, there is a lack of extensive, reliable public transportation. This is partly due to the
        previously mentioned question of wealth: public transportation in many parts of the country is seen as welfare.
        See below for the Strongsville, Ohio mall and the size of the parking lot that services it.

        To me, suburbanites’ connections to the natural world is the only real amenity that one may not find as
        accessible anywhere else. Where present, parks and nature reserves serve as a quiet respite from busy life. But
        even this comes at the cost of the natural world’s commodification; in the eyes of Mother Nature, it is a
        selfish act to divide forests with innumerable roads and trails for human enjoyment. Forests and lakes,
        previously undisturbed places, become spots of recreation for those who can afford to make the trip to them and
        infrastructure facilitating transportation and recreation are quickly created to take advantage of their capital
        gain. The human landscape is now dominating the natural landscape so much that nature, as we conceptualize it,
        is now manmade.

        As someone who grew up in the suburbs and has experienced less resource-intensive ways of living since, I have
        begun to understand both the advantages and disadvantages, costs and privileges that come with living in an
        American suburb. From experience and further research, this thesis became an attempt to reveal underlying
        socio-political tensions of the suburban landscape and to remind suburbanites that our friends in the natural
        world exist, even as we seek to conform their habitats to our own.

      <h2>SYNTHESIS</h2>
      <p>
        The problems discussed above are not easy to solve. Habits are grounded in cultural belief and foundational
        understanding and quick changes to such things across so many people is impossible. Change must come slowly and
        as a collective. The vastness of the suburban landscape poses an interesting problem for an architecture
        student: how could a single structure conveying these ideals reach a target audience spread across thousands of
        miles? Architecture is typically built in one place and serves the community surrounding it. A static structure
        is clearly not the correct choice. The medium must be something that could travel place to place. A mobile
        medium that reaches those who might not encounter these ideas otherwise. A direct description might appear as a
        method of challenging beliefs rather than simply sharing alternative beliefs. Thus, the thesis becomes a board
        game. Mechanics and rules of board games act as a platform for players to role-play, embody and learn together.
      </p>

        This thesis chose to focus on the issues regarding the devaluation of the natural world. Suburban development
        continues to expand outwards, covering forests, fields, and other habitats with single-family homes and asphalt.
        In light of the ever-increasing issues of climate change and biodiversity loss, suburban development and its
        lifestyle are becoming increasingly negative. The protagonists of the game are the Woodland Creatures of the
        natural world. In light of their habitat destruction, they must face evil and work together in order to come out
        alive.


        In any good narrative, a well-rounded villain and antagonist is absolutely necessary to drive a conflict. The
        thesis’s villain is the Developer: a wealthy individual in the suburbs that represents and embodies the issues
        of suburbia. The Developer and the Woodland Creatures struggle for territory on the board, and power dynamics
        and imbalances between the two parties arise.
      </p>
      <img id="9" src="../mats/sprawl_resilience/reality.jpg" class="medium-in-line">
      <p>
        The mechanics of the game give far more power to the Developer than to the Woodland Creatures. It is intended
        that as players sit around a table together, a social dynamic arises where the few (the Developer) have the
        majority of the power in changing the board state and the many (the Woodland Creatures) must rapidly adapt their
        actions to combat impending decisions and strategies.

        Fortunately, the step of creating a dynamic board grounded in reality had unexpected historical precedent the
        thesis could draw from. In 1785 and to circumvent issues of change in the natural world, Thomas Jefferson
        proposed that sale and surveying of land in the United States, despite most natural boundaries, be fit to a
        grid. Jefferson’s method is still in use and these square mile plots of land are clearly visible from an aerial
        view. The grid’s disregard for the boundaries, habitats, and wildlife of the land set a standard for American
        living that is still evident in midsets today. The Jefferson Grid, well-documented by artist and photographer
        Shabtai Panchevshy, serves as a tile system from which the board game thesis took advantage of. The board became
        a 14in by 14in square, poised for a possible 16 square mile tiles of development.

      <h2>OUTCOME</h2>
      <p>
        This thesis manifests itself as an asymmetrical board game where the Woodland Creatures and the Developer have a
        power struggle over a portion of land. The Woodland Creatures, consisting of up to 5 players, fill the roles of
        native flora and fauna and are powerless on their own. Only through collaboration, communication, and
        synergizing of character-specific abilities, can begin to have real impact on the board. The Developer, a one
        player team, makes broad strokes through the process of development. Her gameplay, known as engine building,
        consists of a positive feedback loop between capital investments and income.

        On the board, the Woodland Creatures are represented as figurines, open and readily affected by changes in the
        board state. The Woodland Creatures work together in order to halt the impending development and make the
        forests resilient. Their gameplay style is all about adapting to change as a team, making decisions together
        that best fits their collective win-condition. The Developer, on the other hand, is not represented on the
        board. The player embodies the Developer character, physically representing the idea of the top-down vision of a
        suburban developer. The Developer works solo, making decisions based on his or her current and projected income,
        trying to maximize profit while working around the cooperative efforts of the Woodland Creatures. She spends
        time each turn awarding his or herself capital income, making moves to develop, laughing maniacally, and bathing
        in her power.

        The actions and relationships between players constructs tensions between the Developer and the Woodland
        Residents. The constructed dynamic that arises from one player with lots of power vs many with not small amounts
        becomes contradictory to the physical presence the players have when seated when around the table. This designed
        experience highlights the inequalities that arise from classes, power struggles, and erasure. The Woodland
        Creatures are influenced to use practices of commoning to combat the imbalances they face from the other side of
        the board.

        The thesis and board game were fortunate enough to be exhibited in the 2022 Carnegie Mellon University School of
        Architecture Symposium, where many took part in learning the rules and playing. The social dynamic between teams
        did arise. It was exciting to discuss and learn from this experience as problems regarding replayability of the
        board game were brought to light. I learned that if the game was to become a widespread, accessible critique of
        the suburbs, some changes would need to be made.

      <h1>Poetry & Rationality</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>
        The push and pull of the two sides of my brain is a topic I’ve thought about a lot,
        mostly in relation to the dueling personalities of my parents (my
        mother: the right brain, my father: the left). For a long time, I believed that I was a left-brain
        person, a cold, analytical thinker who made decisions based on probabilities and logic. At the time,
        if you asked me what I was learning in architecture school, I might’ve told you that I
        was really starting to use my right brain for the design of buildings. But soon after, I began to realize
        that the belief that I was a left-brain person allowed for the neglectance of empathy and
        compassion. This pattern is something that I’ve started to notice permeates American society. “My
        statistic is higher valued than your experience.” The dominating left-brain is made ever more
        popular with our reliance on data and the continued saturation of western thought. To ignore
        its other half is to fall into the trap.

      <p class="musing">
        &emsp;The fact that we need breaks from our computer screen lends some starting insight:
        western society has an enormous reliance on visual representation. We know this. The better a
        design appears in images and representation, the more sure the buyer or client can be of its
        success. We live to get and we get what we see. The visual is the portrayal of a concrete,
        unmoving, illustrated entity. It finds itself nearly everywhere in 21st century life. We,
        especially, find it extremely relevant in the realm of architecture.
        The most ‘complete’ architecture allows no room for interpretation and, instead, has
        entire clarity of the designer’s intent. The common misconception that an architect is the
        “framer” of their work highlights this fallacy. Leaving no room for interpretation of use and
        meaning, the imagination of the user has no relevancy, it excludes them.
        Anticipation of needs is often misplaced due to a misunderstanding ingrained in the
        ego of the architect. Though a design may be well intended, the impact will always vary
        person to person.

        Wind<br>
        4/6/21<br><br>
        I feel the wind rattling the leaves,<br>
        I feel its refreshing embrace,<br>
        I close my eyesand take a deep breath<br>
        Now that it’s getting colder, my parents insist<br>
        I wear my jacket wherever I go outside.<br>
        I know they’re right, but<br>
        Hatethat it weighs me down.<br>
        I hear the leaves on the ground shift<br>
        And see a robin looking for insects.<br>
        It stops moving and stares at me.<br>
        I stare back.<br>
        I’ve been out here often<br>
        The past few months.<br>
        Sometimes with my older brother, but always<br>
        When tensions in the house arise.<br>
        My brother’saway now, but that doesn’t<br>
        Bother metoo much.<br>
        I love sitting<br>
        Feeling the wind<br>
        Listening to the trees<br>
        Instead of the duel raging back inside.<br>
        My eyes refocus<br>
        As the robin flies away,<br>
        I feel theair grow colder<br>
        As it brushes up against me.<br>
        I recede into my jacketand grow warm once more.<br>

        &emsp;Judith Butler, in her book Frames of War, claims that the choice and composition of
        the framing of photography tells us as much about the photographer as it does the subject
        of the photo. I think this is so interesting. And I think this concept transcends photography.
        Our mind’s eye is constantly painting imagery, thought, and emotion related to our
        interpretation. Though the architect, photographer, or poet may mean one thing, the
        overlaying of our perception - our “framing” - will cause it to mean something else entirely.

        Myself<br>
        4/21/21<br><br>
        Who came first? Language or counting? Or definition myself?<br>
        A story of the birth of precision is symptomatic of myself.<br>
        A question of the grand expanse of present tenses;<br>
        Where oneand all began and each and every sees myself.<br>
        Spinning aseries of sticky strings of self-reference,<br>
        How many of the infinite slices are able to see myself?<br>
        I insist origin must be; will I be known once found?<br>
        What can and cannot? What can is only myself.<br>
        Following its string leads to a wander with no destination.<br>
        Safer to stare at an obscured rejection of myself.<br>
        Others ares imple. I say so and I'm alone.<br>
        My greatest struggle is the sculpting of myself.<br>

        &emsp;So what I’m saying is that I’m the center of the universe? No, I’m a continuous steam
        of malleable rules and shifting patterns of thought. It’s more like I am my own universe.
        Hopefully that makes some sense.
        But if we’re all separate universes, each with different rules and patterns, what is
        mutual understanding? Can it even exist?

        &emsp;It’s impossible to communicate anything fully. In the process of transmission and
        reception, the smallest differences in our fundamental understandings of a topic produce
        different results. In fact, you’re doing it right now. We
        literally can’t not interpret things differently than our friend and neighbor. Our mind finds a
        way to fit new information in with the old and rationalizes connections while doing so. This
        presentation is being interpreted in as many different ways as there are individuals listening.
        We do share some common understanding. This overlap, though comforting, is quite
        boring. The clashing of different understanding is what defines us as separate individuals. I
        am my experiences and actions, and they are me. Nothing I think or draw or say or do can
        every truly be separate. My being is not limited to the ends of my body.

        Horizon<br>

        &emsp;The interpretable inconsistency I’m discussing is as prevalent in architecture and the
        visual arts as it is the written ones. It’s just harder to see, masked behind centuries of
        conditioning and belief.
        I believe the drastic difference of our emotional takeaways of a string of words and
        letters is actually common ground. The acceptance that everything has these moments of
        complete disconnection is not a bad thing.
        Western culture sees disconnection as an opportunity to learn and benefit itself.
        Western culture claims empathy when in means complete understanding. It misunderstands
        the value of compassion. I used to misunderstand—and I'm stil learning—the value of compassion.
